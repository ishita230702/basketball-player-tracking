# 🏀 Basketball Player Tracking – Project Orion

This project is part of the School of IT Capstone program. It focuses on detecting and tracking basketball players and the ball using YOLOv8 and Deep SORT.

## 📌 Objectives
- Train a YOLOv8n model on basketball game image data
- Test on video to detect players and basketballs
- Implement Deep SORT for identity tracking
- Save output videos with bounding boxes and tracked IDs

## 📁 Files
- `basketball_player_tracking_2.ipynb`: Contains the full pipeline from training to inference and tracking.
- `basketball_detected_output.mp4`: Output video with detection results (can be shared via Drive).
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## 🚧 Next Steps
- Improve dataset with better annotations and diverse players
- Retrain model and improve tracking accuracy
- Explore fatigue detection from tracking data (planned)
